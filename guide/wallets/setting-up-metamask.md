# Metamask Wallet

### Metamask Setup

To use the many features offered by the OxSwap dApp, you must have MetaMask set up on the Harmony network and connected to the site.\
\
MetaMask is available as a browser extension and mobile app that acts as a wallet and secure login.

If you have experience using MetaMask, simply connect your MetaMask using the orange “Connect MetaMask” button on the top right corner of the site.

Connecting MetaMask to the Harmony Network

MetaMask is automatically set up to the Ethereum network, so we will have to add the Harmony Mainnet in order to use OxSwap.

OxSwap makes it easy to connect to your MetaMask and start trading. You have two ways to connect:

Automatic Connection:

You can automatically connect your MetaMask to the Harmony Mainnet by clicking the “Utilities” tab and at the top of the page under “Metamask RPCs For Harmony” pressing the “Add Mainnet RPC Shard 0” button.

&#x20;Important: Right now you can only use OxSwap on Shard 0.&#x20;
