# Remove Liquidity

Removing liquidity for a pool is just as easy as adding it.

To recover your funds, on the liquidity page simply select both tokens for which you have added liquidity, and click 'Remove Liquidity' on the page.

Enter the amount of Liquidity pool tokens you wish to give back, these tokens will be burned and your tokens which you have supplied will be returned to your wallet.

If you have never removed liquidity from the pair, an approval is needed to allow the contracts to use your LP tokens.

Click 'Remove -' to proceed with the liquidity removal.  A pop-up will appear in your wallet to confirm that transaction. &#x20;

Once confirmed in your wallet, you will receive two notifications about your transaction from OxSwap: a notification the transaction was sent and a notification the transaction was completed.

And that's it !
