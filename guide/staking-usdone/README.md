# Staking $ONE

With OxSwap, you have the ability to control your delegated tokens directly through the OxSwap website on the 'Farm' page. Granting the ability to stake / unstake and view details about your delegated tokens all on OxSwap. The ability to choose the percentage of rewards you would like to receive in OXST grants the user more flexibility with their rewards.

This interface allows you to stake or unstake $ONE with the validator directly through the OxSwap website while using the Harmony Browser Wallet. Alleviating the need to visit multiple websites unnecessarily. OpenSwap is your one stop shop for DeFi.

### Control your destiny: Choose the percentage of OXST rewards

The 20% APY Node Validator has always produced 100% of rewards in OXST. Through the interface on OpenSwap, you can now select the percentage of rewards you would like to receive in OXST tokens. You may choose between 30% and 100%. Whatever percentage you select, those rewards will be used to market buy OXST and send it to the delegator address. The remaining percentage of rewards will be issued to you as $ONE tokens. This process occurs every 30 minutes.

For example, if you choose to receive 50% OXST, your rewards will be 50% OXST and 50% ONE. Makes it pretty easy to create a OXST / ONE LP, stake, and farm.

### _**$ONE rewards airdopped**_

With the OpenSwap Validator, you will no longer need to go to the Harmony Staking site and claim the rewards for your $ONE tokens. All rewards, $OXST and $ONE, will be sent directly to the delegator address. This transaction will occur every 30 minutes; just sit back and watch your balance grow.
