# Updating Reward Ratio

The 20% APY Node Validator has always produced 100% of rewards in OXST. Through the interface on OxSwap, you can now select the percentage of rewards you would like to receive in OXST tokens. You may choose between 30% and 100%. Whatever percentage you select, those rewards will be used to market buy OXST and send it to the delegator address. The remaining percentage of rewards will be issued to you as $ONE tokens and will be airdropped to the delegator's address. This process occurs every 30 minutes.

For example, if you choose to receive 50% OXST, your rewards will be 50% OXST and 50% ONE. Makes it pretty easy to create a OXST / ONE LP, stake, and farm.
