# OXST 20% APY Validator

### **OXST Node 20% APY : where earning up to 20% APY begins**

One of our largest goals is to accomplish the vision of Harmony’s founder Stephen Tse. We are working to provide Universal Basic income for the people of the world. Utilizing Harmony’s staking platform combined with our liquidity pools we will bring 20% yields to single staking on Harmony, helping provide financial freedom for billions worldwide.

You can access the OXST validator through the [Harmony Staking site](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/mainnet/one1j35d0vd4uzwffeawjjfukn8t9wjt8csungj0z0) or through [OxSwap](../guide/staking-usdone/).  At this time, you must use the Harmony browser wallet if you are delegating to the OxSwap validator.  This is a Harmony limitation, not OxSwap.

When you delegate ONE tokens to this Harmony One validator pool, you will default to receiving 100% of your rewards in the form of OXST Tokens.  This is why there is a 100% fee, 95% is sent back as OXST and 5% is kept as a constant fee for server maintenance and cost.  This 5% maintenance fee is required by Harmony and the lowest we are allowed to set it at.&#x20;

If you [access your delegated tokens through OxSwap](../guide/staking-usdone/updating-reward-ratio.md), you can change the percentage of rewards you receive in OXST. You can now adjust the percentage of the rewards you receive.  &#x20;

### **How do we accomplish 20% APY?**

It all starts with the [OXST 20% Validator](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/mainnet/one1j35d0vd4uzwffeawjjfukn8t9wjt8csungj0z0) on the Harmony One staking site.  ****  Stake your $ONE tokens with the validator.  When $ONE rewards are created, the rewards issued will be swapped for OXST tokens at market price.  The token swap occurs every 30 minutes; these tokens will then be sent to the corresponding wallet of the delegator.  The OXST tokens are converted and sent in a single tx to all the delegators based on their stake weight. Same way it would on a normal validator.  Next we move to the bonus rewards that you receive.

### **Bonus Rewards!!**

There is a farm on OxSwap that automatically injects the additional percentage into the rewards you receive to increase the APY percentage earned to approximately 20%. This serves as a thank you for helping secure the Harmony network with OxSwap. The bonus rewards are automatically sent to the address of the delegator. After you have received all your rewards, you need to put them to work.

### Stake OXST moving to 20% APY and more

From here, stake your rewards in the OXST/ONE LP on OxSwap to increase your returns. Compounding rewards (collecting your rewards, creating LPs, and restaking them) will drastically increase the return percentage you receive. We recommend compounding weekly as it has the best return for the least amount of effort. Since OxSwap operates on Harmony, no need to worry about transaction fees. Each transaction is a fraction of a penny. It is this compounding that results in greater APY% returns.

### **Impact the validator has on OXST**

This validator node helps create automatic and constant buying pressure for the OxSwap token.  ****  Conducting the buys every 30 minutes, there will always be a constant influx of OXST purchase. &#x20;

The transactions for the validator can be found by looking up your delegator address on the Harmony Explorer and going to the 'HRC20 Transfers' tab.
