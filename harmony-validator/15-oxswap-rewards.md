# 15% OxSwap rewards

**OxSwap 15% Validator Node**

When you delegate ONE tokens to this Harmony One validator pool, you'll earn 15% of your rewards in the form of OXST Tokens.  Out of the 20% fee, 15% is sent back to you and 5% is kept as a constant fee.

**This validator node helps create automatic and constant buying pressure for the OxSwap token.** &#x20;

How does this work?\
As long as the validator is elected, when ONE rewards are awarded, 15% of the rewards issued will be swapped for OXST tokens at market price.  The token swap occurs every 10 minutes; these tokens will then be sent to the corresponding wallet of the delegator.  The remaining ONE token rewards will be stored on the harmony one staking platform; where they can be claimed at any time.
